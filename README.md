###> Java Survey Application <###

--> INTRODUCTION

In research of human subjects, a survey is a list of questions aimed at extracting specific data from a particular group of people. Surveys may be conducted by phone, mail, via the internet, and sometimes face-to-face on busy street corners or in malls. Surveys are used to increase knowledge in fields such as social research etc. Online (Internet) surveys are becoming an essential research tool for a variety of research fields, including marketing, social and official statistics research. According to ESOMAR online survey research accounted for 20% of global data-collection expenditure in 2006. According to that, our team will develop a Java survey application that will use online database to store questions and results.

--> ADVANTAGES OF ONLINE/APPLICATION SURVEYS

-	Web surveys/Application surveys are faster, simpler, and cheaper.
-	The entire data collection period is significantly shortened
-	All data can be collected and processed in little more than a few days
-	Online questionnaires may be improved by applying usability testing, where usability is measured with reference to the speed with      which a task can be performed, the frequency of errors and user satisfaction with the interface.

--> DELIVERABLES

-	Create simple, stable and easy to use application interface
-	Define user classification (admin, moderator, user etc.)
-	Organize the SQL database
-	Test and pentest the application while it is in beta phase.
-	Effectiveness evaluation will depend on human interaction with application.
-	Later in the project the focus will be on improving the application interface and application database after we get a feedback that will tell us what we need to correct or what seems hard to use for the users

--> KNOWLEDGE AREAS NEEDED FOR PROJECT

-	Java
-	Software development
-	Microsoft SQL
-	Database Design
-	Graphic design

--> GOALS

Goal of our project is to increase our knowledge about java. Also for completing this project we will need to improve in Microsoft SQL, database Design and graphic design. If we want to be good programmers we need to know this things so I think that this project is very useful and important for us. We will work hard to make it good. During this project we will improve in programming which is very useful because it will teach us logical way of thinking that we can use for other tasks. Soon there will be 2 types of people, the ones who tell computers what to do and the ones who are told by computers what to do. Of course we want to be type of people which will tell computers what to do.  As I already said this project is very important for us and we will work hard to make it well!

--> FINAL CONCLUSION

As we already said we will try to explain and work on some examples through this project to improve our knowledge in Java. Also we will explain what are surveys used for. We plan to develop Java survey application that will use online database to store questions and answers. One of the main aim of this project is also to improve our knowledge in Java and in object oriented programming. Application survey has a lot of advantages that helps us to do faster, simple and cheaper. Thatâ€™s the way programmers should think and so that is the biggest reason we choose this project. Also for completing and advancing this project we will need to improve in Microsoft SQL, database Design and graphic design. All this things are very important and useful for us if we want to be type of people which will tell computers what to do. If we want to be great programmers.
